Do you often feel muscle soreness around your neck and shoulders or discomfort in your lower back after long periods of work? Try my creation, the Posture Guard! This is a fully offline AI posture recognition system deployed on a Raspberry Pi. All you need to do is place the Raspberry Pi and its camera beside your seat and set up the ESP8266 along with the LED matrix screen wherever you like, as long as it's visible to you. Itâ€™s ready to start working! I hope it helps you sit healthier!
